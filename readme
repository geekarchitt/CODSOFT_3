Detailed Description for Level 1 Task 3: Calculator Application Development

In this task, you will create a functional calculator application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator will perform basic arithmetic operations and demonstrate your ability to combine interactivity with user-friendly design. This task tests your knowledge of DOM manipulation, event handling, and logic implementation in JavaScript.

Calculator Application Features
User Interface (UI)

Design a clean and visually appealing calculator layout using HTML and CSS.
Include buttons for digits (0â€“9) and operators (+, -, *, /, =).
Add a display screen at the top to show inputs and results.
Include additional buttons for functionalities such as Clear (C) and Backspace.
Functionalities

Perform basic arithmetic operations:
Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
Implement the Clear (C) button to reset the calculator.
Use the Backspace button to delete the last entered character.
Allow chaining of operations (e.g., 2 + 3 * 4 = 14).
Prevent invalid operations like division by zero, displaying an error message or handling gracefully.
Error Handling

Ensure the application can handle invalid inputs or syntax errors (e.g., ++, /=, etc.).
Display an appropriate error message or reset the screen when invalid operations occur.
Responsive Design

Use CSS to make the calculator responsive across various screen sizes.
Ensure buttons and display adjust well for smaller devices.
